# ✈️ Voyage – AI Travel Itinerary Planner

Voyage is an AI-powered travel itinerary generator designed to help users plan complete trips quickly and efficiently.  
Built as part of a mini project in my academic curriculum, this application uses the **Gemini API** to create personalized travel schedules based on user preferences such as budget, trip duration, and interests.

This project aims to make trip planning more intelligent, automated, and user-friendly.

## Features

### 1. **AI-Generated Itineraries (Gemini API)**
Voyage generates a full **day–night itinerary** including:
- Places to visit  
- Suggested timings  
- Activity categories (adventure, nightlife, food, culture, relaxation)  
- Recommended experiences based on user interests  

The itinerary adapts to:
- Travel budget  
- Number of days  
- Destination pair (From ➝ To)
### 2. **Google Maps Location Links**
Each recommended destination includes:
- Exact location  
- Map navigation link  
- Summary of what to expect  

This helps users explore the place easily without searching manually.

###  3. **Budget-Friendly Recommendations**
Voyage suggests:
- Hotels  
- Restaurants  
- Cafes  
- Popular attractions  

All recommendations are carefully selected to fit the user's **budget preferences**.

###  4. **Live Weather Updates**
Integrated Weather API provides:
- Current temperature  
- Weather condition  
- Travel suitability  

This ensures the itinerary aligns with weather conditions at the destination.


### 5. **Direct Booking Links**
Users can directly access booking pages for:
- Flights  
- Hotels  
- Buses  
- Trains  

This makes the platform an end-to-end travel assistant.

###  6. **Share Itinerary Feature**
Generated itineraries can be **shared with friends or travel partners**, making group travel planning easier.
